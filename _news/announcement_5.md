I have attended the 2023 edition of [Complex Networks and Applications](https://2023.complexnetworks.org/) 🇫🇷 and met old and new friends within the complex networks community. I have had the pleasure of presenting the project "Finding Hidden Swingers in the 2022 Italian Elections
Twitter Discourse", carried out together with the great [Alessia Antelmi](https://alessant.github.io/) and [Lucio La Cava](https://luciolacava.me/). We won the best lighting talk award 🏆
