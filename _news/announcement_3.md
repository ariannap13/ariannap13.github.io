I have just came back from [Complexity72h](https://complexity72h.com/previous-editions/) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, an amazing workshop where research ideas on complex systems turn into pre-prints in only 72h. I had the pleasure to work with [Giulia Pullano](https://giuliapullano.weebly.com/) on analyzing the disruption of human activities caused by extreme climate events in U.S. and its consequence on respiratory disease spreading.
