I attended the first Conference on Computational Social Science CS2Italy in Trento ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, during which the Society for Computational Social Science Italy has been established. It has been a pleasure to present my recent work on [extracting participation in collective action from social media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07368) and my ongoing work on labor unions in the US and their digital communication strategies.
