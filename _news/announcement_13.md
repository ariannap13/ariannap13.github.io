Yesterday I had the chance of giving a talk as part of the [NetPlace Seminar Series](https://netplace.site/seminar/043_arianna_pera/). I gave an overview of my collaborative work on [hidden swing voters in the Twitter discourse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01279) and had a very insightful conversation with the audience on impostor syndrome in academia and why we should think of the PhD as a marathon 🏃🏻‍♂️‍➡️ I am very grateful to the organizers for inviting me: this is such a great initiative for creating a community of young researchers in network science!
