Hi, welcome on my page ‚òÄÔ∏è

I am a PhD student in Computational Social Science at the IT University of Copenhagen where I joined the [NERDS research group](https://nerds.itu.dk/).
I am part of the [COllective COordination through Online Social media (COCOONS)](https://www.cocoons.online/) research project, supervised by [Prof. Luca Maria Aiello](https://www.lajello.com/index.html). My current focus is on identifying the prime elements in social interactions that can lead to the emergence of collective efforts towards finding solutions to social dilemmas, such as climate change.

I have gratuated from the MSc in Data Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca, with a thesis in the use of Natural Language Processing to explain biases in the online discourse, supervised by [Prof. Matteo Luigi Palmonari](https://www.unimib.it/matteo-luigi-palmonari).

My research interests span from `natural language processing` applied to online interactions, to `complex systems` models of human behavior and `opinion dynamics`. 

In my spare time, I enjoy baking (especially italian desserts üáÆüáπ), running and playing board games.
