Hi, welcome on my page ‚òÄÔ∏è

I am a PhD student in Computational Social Science at the IT University of Copenhagen in the [NERDS research group](https://nerds.itu.dk/). I've been a visiting PhD student at the [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan until December 2024, working with [Ceren Budak](http://cbudak.com/index.html).

My research is part of the [COllective COordination through Online Social media (COCOONS)](https://www.cocoons.online/) research project, led by [Prof. Luca Maria Aiello](https://www.lajello.com/index.html). My current focus is on identifying the prime elements in social interactions and language that can lead to the emergence of collective efforts in the realm of social issues, such as climate change.

I have gratuated from the MSc in Data Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca, with a thesis in the use of Natural Language Processing to explain biases in the online discourse, supervised by [Prof. Matteo Luigi Palmonari](https://www.unimib.it/matteo-luigi-palmonari).

My research interests are `natural language processing` applied to social interactions, `discourse frames` used in digital communication, and `social network analysis` of online human behavior. 

In my spare time, I enjoy baking (especially italian desserts üáÆüáπ), running and playing board games.
